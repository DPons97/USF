# USF - Unreal Strategy Framework
A simple framework to build RTS games in Unreal Engine 4

This project goal is to build a simple testbench for developing RTS mechanics using Unreal Engine 4.

Currently, I'm working on reaching a high amount of units/actors placed in the world while keeping a good-enough performance level (60fps).
Each actor has to be able to:
* Being selected by players
* Run an individual AI to move
* Cooperate with other actors to move into formation
* Avoid collisions with other actors while moving [Work In Progress]
